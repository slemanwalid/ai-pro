    This class provides some common elements to all of your

    to the MinmaxAgent, AlphaBetaAgent & ExpectimaxAgent.

    You *do not* need to make any changes here, but you can if you want to
    add functionality to all your adversarial search agents.  Please do not
    remove anything, however.

    Note: this is an abstract class: one that should not be instantiated.  It's
    only partially specified, and designed to be extended.  Agent (Game.py)
    is another abstract class.
